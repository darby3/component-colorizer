# Component Colorizer

A basic tool for building a palette of colors, seeing how it looks in some basic usage conditions, and keeping an eye on accessibility concerns (contrast ratios).

Basically nothing I found did exactly what I had in my head. This also acts as an excuse to build a thing of some moderate value for fun.
